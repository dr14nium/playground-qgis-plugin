# QGIS Plugin Repository

Welcome to the QGIS Plugin Repository! This repository serves as a collection of QGIS plugins that I've developed as part of my learning journey in plugin development for QGIS. Each plugin aims to enhance mapping capabilities and streamline GIS workflows. Explore the plugins below to simplify your mapping tasks and learn more about QGIS plugin development.

## Plugin List

Here's a list of plugins along with links to their folders:

1. [**Sudut & Jarak**](sudut-jarak/): This QGIS plugin allows users to measure angles and distances within the QGIS application.
   
## Installation

To install any of the plugins listed above, follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin file (`plugin_name.zip`) from this project's GitHub page.

2. Open QGIS.

3. Navigate to "Settings" from the main menu, then select "Plugin Manager".

4. Click on the "Install from ZIP" button and choose the downloaded plugin file.

5. Activate the plugin from the list of available plugins.

Now, the plugin should be installed and ready to use in your QGIS environment.
